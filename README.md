# DC-DC-boost-converter
📝 Description
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a non-isolated DC-DC boost converter. The converter steps up an input voltage of 7.5 V to 12.5 V using a switching frequency of 10 kHz. Both Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) operations are demonstrated through waveform analysis of the switch current and diode voltage.
